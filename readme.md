This is a work in progress

The program runs a DICOM SCP service (AET and Port set in the .ini file) that will access DICOM files and if they are DICOM encapsulated pdf will store the pdfs in a folder setup in the .ini file.
The main objective was to have a DICOM receiver for encapsulated pdf ECG files that could write these to a folder.
